  There are different characters for different charsets, but UTF-8 is the standard for HTML files because it includes many international symbols

          if you save the image file into your html folder you can simply refer to the image using the name of the file instead of the url
          in the event that the image can no longer be extracted from the url source, it will now pull the image straight from our saved file.

          em tag is the emphasis tag, which is slightly different from the i tag which italicizes.
          The em tag tells the browser it should put stress or emphasis on the content between the em tag while the i tag only italicizes it.
          Also use the strong tag rather than the bold tag, as strong confers that text is strong importance rather than just visually changing it to bold.
